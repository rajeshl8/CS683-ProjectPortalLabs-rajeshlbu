# Lab 5
Modify your lab4 to implement the following features:
1. Implement Database Operations in AsyncTasks. 
Module 5 shows you an example of using AsyncTask to list projects. Implement database operations such as updates in AsyncTask as well. 
2. Implement Database updates in an Intent Service.
Instead of using an AsyncTask, create an intent service to implement database updates when the user edits the project information.
3. Communicate with UI  (optional)
When the update is done, display a toast message to show the update is successful.
